# Node.JS

Node.js is an open-source, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting - running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Conequently, Node.js, represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server-side and client-side scripts.
