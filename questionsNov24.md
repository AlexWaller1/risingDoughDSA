# What is Local Storage, and what is the difference between local storage and session storage?

A hard drive or solid state drive (SSD) directly attached to the device being referenced. The term would be used to contrast the storage in that unit from the storage on servers in the local network or on the Internet(see SAN, NAS, and cloud storage)

sessionStorage is similar to local storage; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. A page session lasts as long as the tab or the browser is open, and survies over page reloads and restores.
