# EMCA Script

ECMAScript is a general-purpose programming language, standardised by
ECMA International according to the document ECMA-262. It is a JavaScript standard
meant to ensure the interoperabiltity of web pages across different web browsers.
ECMAScript is commonly used for client-side scripting on the World Wide Web, and
it is increasingly being used for writing server applications using Node.js .
